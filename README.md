# Calculator
## Written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS. 
I used CSS grid system for this project. While writing JS part, I intentionally not used built-in eval() function, I wanted completely implement my own solution.
It's working with decimal points also, can chain multiple calculations like: 30 + 12 * 3 - 1
There is functionality to use it with a keyboard or mouse (in mobile touching).

**The special thing about this project for me, is that: I wrote it on my own without reading any other Calculator code or without watching the tutorial.**
